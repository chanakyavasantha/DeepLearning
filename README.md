#### **Machine Learning** :
Development of Algorithmns and computer systems that can learn patterns from the data and are able to predict outcomes without explicit instructions.
#### How is ML different from tradiitional programming:
1. **Approach to Problem Solving:**
   - **Traditional Programming:** Developers manually write code with step-by-step instructions.
   - **Machine Learning:** Algorithms learn from data to make predictions without explicit programming.

2. **Data-Driven vs. Rule-Driven:**
   - **Traditional Programming:** Relies on predefined rules and logic.
   - **Machine Learning:** Learns patterns from data for making predictions.

3. **Adaptability:**
   - **Traditional Programming:** Requires manual code updates for changes.
   - **Machine Learning:** Adapts to new data and situations without code changes.

4. **Complexity and Scaling:**
   - **Traditional Programming:** Can become complex and challenging for large-scale problems.
   - **Machine Learning:** Handles complexity and scales well for large datasets.

5. **Domain Expertise:**
   - **Traditional Programming:** Requires deep domain knowledge to define accurate rules.
   - **Machine Learning:** Learns from domain-specific data, capturing complex patterns.

6. **Problem Types:**
   - **Traditional Programming:** Suited for tasks with clear rules.
   - **Machine Learning:** Suited for tasks with complex patterns, noise, or ambiguity.

7. **Feedback Loop:**
   - **Traditional Programming:** Requires manual code updates based on feedback.
   - **Machine Learning:** Improves over time with more data and model updates.

In summary, traditional programming uses explicit rules, while machine learning learns from data for making predictions. ML excels in complex, data-driven tasks, but requires careful data handling and model tuning.
